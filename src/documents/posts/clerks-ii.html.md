Just saw Clerks II for the second time yesterday. Undoubtedly one of the funniest movies ever! The character Randal,played by Jeff Anderson is just too good. Its amazing that he's just an amateur actor and doesn't even have a picture for his IMDB profile page! The movie is just non-stop comedy, and an excellent sequel to an equally good part 1. Those who haven't seen it yet, go watch it! And trust me, you will love Randal(in a totally heterosexual way of course, if you are male)
