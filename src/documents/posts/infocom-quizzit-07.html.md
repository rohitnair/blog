Quizmaster : Pickbrain

Was pretty jobless that day.I knew the venue was somewhere close to my office and it was a lone wolf quiz,so didn't have to hunt for partners either. Anyways, i opened the [Yahoo! India Maps](http://in.maps.yahoo.com)* page, got the directions from my office to the venue, sent them to my mobile and stepped out of my office. It was a nice walk to the venue, through Cubbon Park. Saw the [Vidhan Soudha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidhana_Soudha) as well. It had "_Government Work is God's Work" _inscribed over the entrance in huge letters.

Reached the venue on time but was surprised to see the participation. Less than 50 people had turned up, and this was an Open Quiz in Bangalore with a cash prize of 20k! There I met Sarin, whom i know from my quizzing days in college. He had come all the way just to attend a couple of quizzes. Amazing enthusiasm. The prelim was the typical Pickbrain fare, loads of clues. Thats when i realized how out of touch i was with quizzing! Couldn't make any guesses and the answers just wouldn't come! I believe i didn't even attempt half the questions. But thanks to the level of participation, i managed to qualifyÂ  for an open quiz in Bangalore for the first time in my life.Yahooooo!

The final round had 8 participants, Sarin, Mitesh Agarwal of SUN and a few students from NLSIU apart from myself. The questions as usual were very work-outable and hardly any got passed to the audience. There were the Pickbrain trademark  crossword and connect rounds, and a couple of rounds on the buzzer. Managed a decent start but as with the prelims, some answers just seemed to be stuck at the tip of my tongue.I had the same complain i have with all other Pickbrain quizzes,it was just too short! There were a total of less than 45 questions and thats just too little especially for an open quiz. Sarin scored well in the big rounds and won while Mitesh scored some 15 pointers in the final round to finish runner up. They both qualify for the National finals in Calcutta. In the end, it was kinda disappointing but encouraging at the same time. Helped renew my interest in quizzing.

* [Yahoo India Maps](http://in.maps.yahoo.com) currently gives you only driving directions. I hope they come out with walking directions as well, could be pretty handy in a place like Bangalore with its zillion one-ways!
