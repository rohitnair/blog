Here's a license with a difference, with an objective to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of all things! WordWeb ( a common English dictionary program) allows you to use the program free of charge beyond the 30 day trial period ONLY if



	
  * You take at most 4 flights (2 return flights) in any 12 month period

	
  * AND you do not own or regularly drive an SUV (sports utility vehicle).


You can read the full license [here](http://wordweb.info/free/licence.html) , at the risk of feeling guilty of software theft of course.

Searched for more such interesting licenses. Here are a few



	
  1. The relatively more famous [WTFPL](http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/) : As the name suggests it allows you to do WTF you want to.

	
  2. Something that calls itselfÂ  ["Shoneware"](http://homepage.usask.ca/~ijm451/prox/help/help/License.html) : This radical new concept in software distribution is in the support of the Shonen Knife, world famous, female power-trio of musicians from Osaka, Japan.

	
  3. [Sisterware](http://spazioinwind.libero.it/unforgiven/frameset.htm) : You can use the program free of cost as long as you send the author information about your sister. And hes actually got 255 messages. You can read them [here](http://spazioinwind.libero.it/unforgiven/sisterware.htm). Good to know honest people still exist in this world.
