Murcia Vs Real Madrid : Final Score 1-1
This week was a case of the good,the bad and the ugly for Guti. Made the assist for the first goal, his laziness resulted in the Murcia goal and finally got himself sent off. Of course,it wouldn't be fair to blame the loss of two points on him, the team and Schuster failed to impress again.
Thankfully Villareal dropped points as well which means its another week at the top of the table.

Sadly,things seem to be much worse at St.James' Park. Another big home defeat means big pressure on Big Sam. There just has to be something about being a Newcastle defender.No matter how good you were previously, you just magically turn into the suckiest defender in the world once you wear the black and white stripes jersey. The scoreline might have read 6-0 had Benitez spent 20 odd million pounds on a better finisher.

Finally some good new,El Il Fenomeno played his first 90 minutes this season for Milan. Won a penalty, hit the woodwork once. He looks fitter than ever!
