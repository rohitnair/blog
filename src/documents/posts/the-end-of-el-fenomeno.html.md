For those who live in Mars, Ronaldo ruptured a tendon on his left knee and was stretchered off during Milan's game against Livorno. I think its a recurrence of the injury he had all those years back, the only difference being that the earlier one happened on the right leg. The surgery happened yesterday and the general recovery period is 8-10 months. He's still only 31 and there's no reason he cannot be back on the football field. Finding a team to play shouldn't be tough for him, its whether he wants to continue that matters. A legend like him deserves a better way to say goodbye to the beautiful game.

PS: A lot of n00bs think the injury is because of his lifestyle and he has self destructed his career and so on. Pure unadulterated crap. Actually an easy way to spot n00bs is just that, see what their opinion of Ronaldo is. They obviously have no clue what a legend the man is and just read into his lifestyle, his waistline etc.
