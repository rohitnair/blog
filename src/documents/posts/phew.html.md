What a week it's been, probably one of my best after coming to Bangalore. To summarize the events,

sprint deadlines, work late, legacy systems, ecstasy(cafe), addiction(cafe),Â  barton fink(movie), meetings, curse IE, bamboo shoots(restaurant), bowling @ amoeba, meet family, home food, football, dostana(movie), taken(movie), skandagiri, night trek, get drenched in rain.

I doubt if I'll be able to move a muscle tomorrow. Time for some much needed rest.
