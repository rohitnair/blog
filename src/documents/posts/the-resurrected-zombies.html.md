Well,that happened to be our team name for yesterdays KQA quizzes. Best part is that we didn't qualify for the quiz for unseeded teams while we qualified quite comfortably for the open quiz(with all the seeded teams participating) Credit to Pravin and Thomas Jacob, they were on a roll for the prelims.And it was awesome to see QED,WALTO and Metaquizziks fighting it out. Some great questions and some stunning answers.
